            NEW YORK — For Coco Gauff, the biggest star in American tennis who took full ownership of the U.S. Open last year, a triumphant sequel just wasn’t on the cards.

            Playing with all the flashes of brilliance, defiance and frustrating instability that have characterized her tennis all summer, Gauff fell Sunday afternoon to her compatriot Emma Navarro in three sets, ending her Grand Slam season without fulfilling her hopes of following up last year’s magical run with another trip to the winner’s circle.

            For the second consecutive time in a major tournament, Navarro, Gauff’s Olympic teammate, used her increasingly dangerous combination of steadiness, speed and power to beat Gauff, knocking her out 6-3, 4-6, 6-3.
            
            Navarro, 23, born in New York and raised in South Carolina, is fast becoming a major force in tennis. She smothered the defending champion in front of Serena Williams, Stephen Colbert, Michael Che and nearly 24,000 fans in Arthur Ashe Stadium, by deciding an occasion marked by pressure, emotion, and drama with the simplest fundamental of tennis. Navarro played cleaner, with strokes that are more fundamentally sound and reliable than Gauff’s high-wire act.

            Navarro, who has shot up the rankings in the last year, became NCAA champion with the Virginia Cavaliers. Now she is the No. 13 seed at her home Grand Slam and rising still, her weaknesses falling away with each passing month.

            “It’s pretty insane,” Navarro said. “This is the city I was born in and it feels so special to be playing here.”

            This was always going to be a rough matchup for Gauff, not least because of the inevitable scar tissue from the loss at Wimbledon in July. Gauff entered that match as favorite, not just to beat Navarro, but to get to the final, with so many of the other top players having already fallen. Then Navarro appeared across the net, doing what she has done pretty much all year. She ran down ball after ball, extending rallies and simply refusing to miss, hanging in there long enough for Gauff’s Achilles heels — the instability of her forehand and of her serve — to let her down.
